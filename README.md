# TaskReminder
This is a Kotlin implementation of TaskReminder Android application. This application will allow the users to make a list of tasks and putting individual reminders on them. The user will get a notification at the specified time.

# How to use the application:
1. After runnning the application, you will land into the home page (which will be blank on your first run).
2. On the home page, you will find a Floating Button with '+' sign in the bottom right corner. Use this button to add a task that you need to remind yourself.
3. The button will take you to a new screen that allows you to enter the title, note and date & time of the particular task.
4. After entering the details just press 'back' button to save the task.
5. If your task has a particular date and time, you will get a reminder for the task (only if the time is in the future).
6. The task will appear on the home screen in a distinct card. You can always click on the card to edit the details.
7. To delete a task, long click on the particular task's card on the home screen and press 'Yes' in the delete prompt.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To make sure that the notifications work properly and to not miss any of the reminders, allow the application to run in the background and pin/lock the application in the 'Recents'.
